How to use the RPS AI program

1. Open up a Command Line application
2. Type : gradlew run
3. Press Enter.
4. Open up your browser, and enter the address http://localhost:7777
5. Start playing by pressing the Rock / Paper / Scissors buttons.

There is also an somewhat cryptic site http://localhost:7777/sessions where you can view the Game statistics for each session, where you can see how well each AI would have played 
in that specific session, if they were the only AI responsible for the selections.\

Tests will not be able to run through NetBeans Test button.
For tests, refer to the TestDocumentation document, which contain instructions on
how to reproduce the tests.

Upon further examination, the program will most likely not run from a Linux or Mac device, due to the fact that the ChromeDriver.exe
will not work outside of Windows environments. Might fix this later if I have time to look up drivers for mac and linux aswell.
